<h3>vdk-signals</h3>
<p><strong>vdk-signals</strong> is a one header library, which implements a type-safe, thread-safe signals &amp; slots system in C++. It is written entirely in pure standard C++ with high performance and efficiency in mind. The main intention of the library is to provide fast, simple and robust signal class that can be treated almost as a C++ build-in type for any application.</p>
<p>vdk-signals relies on C++ Standard Library only, and does not require any pre-compilation steps, non-standard extensions or third party libraries. Everything you need is in one header, just put it in your project, #include and use. The interface of the library is designed to be intuitive, very simple, and with clean syntax.</p>
<p>High speed is achieved through the use of modern C++ features and atomic variables to ensure thread-safety and fastest possible execution. Specialized synchronization mechanism makes signal emission lock-free and wait-free, avoiding any undesirable consequences introduced by locks.</p>
<p>vdk-signals follows the main philosophy of C++ language, and does its best to avoid unnecessary overheads and needless functionality that can slow down your application. It is one of the most important rules of the library, since it is designed to work in high-load systems.</p>
<p>Special care has been taken regarding memory usage efficiency to ensure complete absence of memory leaks or memory fragmentation. You can choose whether you want to allocate all memory for the signal object as one memory block up-front, or allocate it as separate parts later when your program runs.</p>
<p>Signals can be connected to any callable target in your application. It can be standalone function, static method, method (with any qualifiers), function object, lambda and even another signal. Auto-disconnection is also supported. Any slot that needs an object to be called on, can be tracked by signal, meaning that it will be disconnected automatically once the tracked object is destroyed.</p>
<p>This library enables any object in your program work as an independent software component that can communicate with other unrelated components through signals and slots. This approach allows true decoupling, makes your design clearer, and increases reusability of your code.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> vdk-signals library requires compiler compatible with at least C++11 Standard.</p>
<p>Tutorial, Design Rationale, and Detailed Documentation are available in one file, and can be found <a href="doc/signals.pdf">here</a> or in the library package.</p>
